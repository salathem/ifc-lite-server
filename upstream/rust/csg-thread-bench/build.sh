# Build the rung-2 CSG bench into web/pkg-plain and web/pkg-threaded, then
# serve with `node web/serve.mjs` and open
#   http://localhost:8099/?pkg=threaded&mode=csg&model=<fixture>&parallel=1&threads=8
#
# The threaded bundle pulls wasm-bindgen-rayon, whose generated worker helper
# does a *directory* dynamic import (`import('../../..')`). A bare static file
# server (web/serve.mjs) cannot resolve a directory specifier, so the worker
# silently fails to boot and the threaded run hangs before `initThreadPool`
# resolves. The production pipeline avoids this in scripts/build-wasm.sh by
# rewriting the helper after wasm-pack; we apply the SAME rewrite here so the
# bench is runnable straight after a build with no manual patching. (#1255 P2)

# cargo invocation in the workspace, not just wasm ones, and collided with
# `[profile.release] panic = "abort"` on plain host builds (see
# scripts/build-wasm.sh), so it's now scoped per-invocation via this env var
# instead. Set it here too so the plain bundle keeps rebuilding std from
# source exactly as before, instead of silently falling back to the
# prebuilt std for wasm32-unknown-unknown.
