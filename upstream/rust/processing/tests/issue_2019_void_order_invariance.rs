//! Regression for #2019: the world geometry hash must be invariant to the
//! order `IFCRELVOIDSELEMENT` statements appear in the file.
//!
//! `void_index` (host element id -> Vec<opening id>) used to be built by
//! scanning the file's `IFCRELVOIDSELEMENT` relationships in the order they
//! are written, then pushed straight into `Vec<u32>` with no
//! canonicalisation (`rust/processing/src/prepass.rs`, the `spans.void_rels`
//! loop). The wall CSG kernel subtracts openings from a host SEQUENTIALLY
//! when they cannot join the disjoint-cutter batch or the coaxial-overlap
//! union pass, and each intermediate cut's f64->f32->snap round trip can
//! re-jitter carve vertices — so cutting the SAME set of openings in a
//! different order can produce a numerically (or even topologically)
//! different mesh. The fix sorts each host's opening ids by express id once,
//! at `resolve_prepass` construction time, so accumulation order is a
//! property of the model rather than of the file's byte layout.
//!
//! `tests/fixtures/issue_2019_wall_two_overlapping_openings.ifc` is a ~2 KB
//! hand-authored fixture: one `IFCWALL` and THREE `IFCOPENINGELEMENT`s whose
//! footprints mutually overlap at three different angles (0°, ~37°, ~53°) so
//! none can join the disjoint-cutter batch. Two tests:
//!
//! - [`sequential_cut_order_is_not_associative`] confirms the MECHANISM: with
//!   every analytic fast path forced off, feeding the raw (uncanonicalised)
//!   opening order straight into the mesh pipeline in different permutations
//!   produces different triangle counts / hashes. This is a property of the
//!   CSG kernel this issue does not ask to change, so it is asserted as
//!   "diverges", not "must match" — it is expected to stay true forever and
//!   is here to document WHY the fix lives at the void_index construction
//!   site rather than in the kernel.
//! - [`world_geometry_hash_is_invariant_to_reordered_void_rel_statements`] is
//!   the actual regression: it goes through the REAL production entry point
//!   (`resolve_prepass`, via a hand-built `PrepassSpans` scan — the exact
//!   mechanism both the native and wasm pipelines share) against the
//!   original file and a byte-identical copy with only the three
//!   `IFCRELVOIDSELEMENT` statements reordered, and asserts the resolved
//!   `void_index` and the resulting hash/AABB are identical either way.
