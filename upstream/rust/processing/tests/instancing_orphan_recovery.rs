//! #1623 Phase 2 don't-bake: proves the orphan-recovery fallback in
//! `processor/instancing.rs::recover_orphan_occurrences` actually fires and
//! recovers geometry when the plan's designated TEMPLATE occurrence (the
//! min-id `IfcMappedItem` for a repeated source) never materializes.
//!
//! `finalize_instances`'s doc comment calls this path "effectively
//! unreachable for the eligible single-solid type-instanced set (their
//! template occurrence always materializes)". That claim does not hold once
//! the opening filter (`OpeningFilterMode::IgnoreAll`) is combined with
//! instancing: `mapped_item_plan`'s template selection (`processor/mod.rs`,
//! scanning every `IFCMAPPEDITEM` up front) is computed WITHOUT knowledge of
//! which owning product jobs the filter will later skip
//! (`apply_opening_filter` / `skipped_entity_ids`, consulted only in
//! `jobs::process_entity_job`). If the plan's chosen template id belongs to
//! an `IfcWindow`/`IfcDoor` job the filter skips, that job's `EntityDecoder`
//! path returns before the router ever sees mapped item — so
//! `is_template` (`geometry/src/router/processing.rs`) is `item.id ==
//! template_item_id` for every SURVIVING occurrence too, and none of them
//! is ever `true`. Every occurrence of that source becomes a don't-bake
//! placeholder, `template_by_rep.get(&rep)` finds no non-empty template mesh,
//! and the whole group must fall to `recover_orphan_occurrences` or its
//! geometry is silently dropped.
//!
//! Before this test, NO test in the suite exercised
//! `recover_orphan_occurrences`: deleting its body (returning before the
//! bake loop, so every orphan occurrence is silently dropped) left all other
//! processing tests green.
