//! #1985: the `IfcMappedItem` transform is `MappingTarget · MappingOrigin`.
//!
//! Both fixtures author their geometry in METRE numbers inside an
//! `IfcRepresentationMap` and instantiate it into a MILLIMETRE model through a
//! uniform `Scale = 1000` `IfcCartesianTransformationOperator3D` — the exact
//! shape reported in #1985.
//!
//! `scaled_kinds` pins the SCALE half: every mapped occurrence must land on the
//! same world geometry as the identical solid authored directly in millimetres.
//! `mapping_origin` pins the half that was actually broken: the map's
//! `MappingOrigin` (attr 0) was dropped everywhere in the mesh path, so a
//! non-identity origin placed the geometry at the wrong spot — and, being
//! composed INSIDE the target, its error was multiplied by the target scale
//! (1 m of origin became a 1 m miss here, but 0 m of movement before the fix).
