//! The extraction-level output cap and its diagnostics (#2937, #2938).
//!
//! `item_walk.rs` bounds ONE top-level representation item.
//! `extract_symbolic_data` calls that walk once per item of every
//! Plan/Annotation/FootPrint/Axis representation of every product and
//! accumulates into a single `SymbolicData`, so before this the file-level
//! total was `items x per-item bound` and nothing bounded the extraction:
//! 20,002,500 polylines and 2.74 GB RSS from a 1.13 MB upload, on a path the
//! HTTP server calls with raw uploaded bytes.
//!
//! EVERY test below was verified to FAIL against the production behaviour it
//! names, by running the mutation rather than reasoning about it. That check
//! found two tests that could not fail:
//!
//!   - the "every variable-length field is charged" test used a 2-byte content
//!     with a 4 KB alignment, so dropping the CONTENT charge changed nothing
//!     and it stayed green while claiming to pin both;
//!   - the "does not abandon the file" test asserted `len() > 1`, which passes
//!     even when a per-item bound wrongly sets exhaustion and abandons every
//!     later product.
//!
//! Both are now built to discriminate. This is the fourth and fifth time in
//! this change that a fixture written to prove a fix shared the fix's
//! assumption, so the mutation run is not optional here.
//!
//! RESIDUAL, measured and not fixed here: the bounds are on OUTPUT, so they
//! bound work only insofar as work produces output. A fan-out whose leaf is an
//! item type the extractor does not handle traverses fully and emits nothing,
//! so neither bound ever fires:
//!
//!   179 KB -> 426 ms, 0 emitted      739 KB -> 1661 ms, 0 emitted
//!   3.0 MB -> 7216 ms, 0 emitted
//!
//! Linear at ~2.4 ms/KB. Not a regression -- `main` behaves identically, and
//! it is #2937's original per-item-budget complaint in the shape where output
//! capping cannot reach it. Closing it means hoisting the revisit budget from
//! per-item to per-extraction, which is now safe BECAUSE truncation is
//! reported, but changes truncation behaviour for legitimate multi-product
//! files and wants its own change.
//!
//! The two issues pulled in opposite directions -- bounding total work made
//! the silent truncation fire sooner, on smaller legitimate drawings -- so
//! they are fixed by one instrument: a cap on the OUTPUT, plus a diagnostics
//! field that says the cap was hit. Both halves are pinned here.
//!
