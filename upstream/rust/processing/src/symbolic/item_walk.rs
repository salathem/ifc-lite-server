//! Bounds for the symbolic representation-item walk (issue #2866).
//!
//! Split out of `items.rs` so the guards are readable on their own: `items.rs`
//! is the per-IFC-type dispatch, and this is the policy that keeps it from
//! walking a hostile file forever. Everything here is about WHAT the walk is
//! allowed to do; nothing here knows about any IFC type.

/// itself, the `IfcMappedItem -> IfcRepresentationMap ->
/// IfcShapeRepresentation.Items` chain, and `IfcCompositeCurve.Segments ->
/// IfcCompositeCurveSegment.ParentCurve`. This walk is reachable from
/// `extract_symbolic_data` on raw uploaded bytes
/// (`apps/server/src/services/streaming.rs`), so unbounded each one aborts the
/// process with a stack overflow -- an abort, not a catchable panic (#2866).

/// into a hang -- measured at 7.21s for k=3 on the sibling resolver in #2864
/// before its guard landed. This is the breadth bound.
///
/// Charged on REVISITS ONLY, which is what makes it safe to have at all. An
/// earlier version charged every visit, and that silently truncated a
/// WELL-FORMED file: `IfcGeometricSet` recurses per element, so one flat set
/// of 200,050 curves emitted 199,999 and dropped 51 with no error -- plan
/// hatching, a survey drawing or imported DWG geometry reaches that size
