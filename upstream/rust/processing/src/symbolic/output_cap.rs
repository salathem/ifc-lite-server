/// `IfcGeometricCurveSet` of 200,050 curves is legitimate (plan hatching, a
/// survey drawing, an imported DWG), and a nested block import reaching

/// the fan-out attack re-emits ONE leaf up to the cap, cloning its point vector
/// every time. So the leaf is paid for once in the file and two million times

///       1024   2.03 MB   2,000,000      16.70 GB
///
/// Linear, and six times worse than the 2.74 GB the count cap was written to
/// fix. A count cap tuned on a 2-point fixture measures the fixture, not the
/// bound.

/// every variable-length field must be in the payload and not just the obvious
