//! Cycle and fan-out guards for `extract_symbolic_item` (issue #2866).
//!
//! This walk is reachable from `extract_symbolic_data` on raw uploaded bytes
//! (`apps/server/src/services/streaming.rs`), and every id it follows comes
//! from the file. Unbounded, each of the three cycle edges below aborts the
//! process with a stack overflow — an abort, not a catchable panic.
//!
//! Every test asserts the SAFE RESULT rather than "does not crash": a stack
//! overflow takes the whole test binary down as SIGABRT, which reads as broken
//! infrastructure instead of a failed assertion.
