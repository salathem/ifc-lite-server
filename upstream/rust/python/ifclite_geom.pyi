    ``numpy.frombuffer``.

    Vertices are welded, IFC Z-up, absolute-world metres, keyed by IFC STEP id
    (occurrences only). ``ifc_bytes`` is the raw IFC file content, e.g.
    ``open(path, "rb").read()``.

    ``quality`` scales the segment count on every curved primitive (swept-disk
    tubes, cylinders, revolutions, arcs). ``None`` means ``"medium"``, the
    engine default. Each step is a factor of two in density, so ``"lowest"``
    is roughly a tenth of ``"medium"``'s triangle budget on curve-heavy
    elements such as reinforcing bars.

) -> EntityData:
    """Read attributes, property sets and quantity sets. No tessellation.

    ``entities`` is keyed by IFC STEP id in file order, so it joins directly
    against ``geometry_data_buffers(...)["elements"]``. The join is one-way
    total: every meshed element has a row here, but not every row has an
    element. Besides products with no geometry, an orphan ``IfcTypeProduct``
    gets a row with ``has_geometry=True`` and still never appears in
    ``elements``, because the geometry functions emit occurrences only. Drive
    the join from ``elements``, or use ``.get()``.

    Property values are strings and quantity values are floats, both in the
    file's OWN units -- a millimetre model reports a length of ``3000`` where
    geometry from this module is always metres.

    Converting is per dimension, not one blanket factor: multiply a ``Length``
    by ``length_unit_scale``, an ``Area`` by its SQUARE and a ``Volume`` by its
    CUBE, and use ``plane_angle_to_radians`` for angles. ``Count`` is
    dimensionless. Only the length and plane-angle scales are resolved, so a
    model declaring an area or volume unit inconsistent with its length unit
    cannot be reconciled from what is returned here.

    Pass ``placements=True`` to resolve each product's ``ObjectPlacement``;
    it is off by default because it costs an extra decode per product. The
    resulting matrix is in the same absolute IFC world frame as
    ``geometry_data_buffers`` vertices, so the two line up directly. Do not
    fold ``rtc_offset`` into either: the geometry export already adds it back
    into every vertex, and this placement is never RTC-rebased.

    ``type_properties`` (on by default) also returns what each occurrence
    inherits from its ``IfcTypeObject`` through ``IfcRelDefinesByType``. A type
    attaches its sets via ``HasPropertySets`` and gets no row of its own unless
    it carries orphan geometry, so without this the properties authoring tools
    put on types are unreachable. The merge is per property:

    * A type set whose name the occurrence does not use is added whole.
    * A type set sharing a name contributes only the properties the occurrence
      does not already define, so the occurrence wins a collision and the
      type-only properties beside it still survive.

    ``quantity_sets`` inherit on exactly the same terms. A type attaches
    ``IfcElementQuantity`` definitions through the same ``HasPropertySets``
    attribute, so they arrive by the same route and merge by the same rule: a
    type quantity set the occurrence does not name is added whole, and a
    same-named one contributes only the quantities the occurrence does not
    already define, so the occurrence wins a collision. One flag governs both
    lists.

    Pass ``type_properties=False`` for own-sets-only, as in 4.3.0, which
    affects ``property_sets`` and ``quantity_sets`` alike.

    Remaining limit, inherited from the shared export model: only
    ``IfcPropertySingleValue`` properties are decoded. Enumerated, list,
    bounded, table and reference properties are skipped silently, and the pset
    still appears with those entries missing.

    ``attributes`` (on by default) returns each entity's SCHEMA-DECLARED IFC
    attributes, which are not property sets and which no amount of pset work
    surfaces. An ``IfcReinforcingBar`` can carry ``SteelGrade``,
    ``NominalDiameter``, ``CrossSectionArea``, ``BarLength``,
    ``PredefinedType``, ``BarSurface`` and ``Tag``; an ``IfcDoor`` can carry
    ``OverallHeight`` / ``OverallWidth``, and so on for every class, named and
    ordered as the schema declares them.

    Only what the file actually sets is returned: an attribute left ``$`` is
    omitted rather than reported empty, so the list is usually shorter than the
    class declares.

    Entries share the ``{name, value, value_type}`` shape of a property, so one
    code path reads both. Fields this dict already carries (``global_id``,
    ``name``, ``description``, ``object_type``) are not repeated, and
    reference-valued attributes are omitted rather than rendered as a dangling
    id.

    Raises:
        RuntimeError: the extraction pipeline failed.
