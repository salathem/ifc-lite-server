//! IFC Z-up → WebGL Y-up frame conversion for the **from-bytes** exporters.
//!
//! `ifc_lite_processing::process_geometry` emits geometry in the producer-native
//! IFC **Z-up** frame. The Z-up→Y-up swap that every rendered/exported mesh
//! normally undergoes happens at the wasm FFI (`MeshDataJs::new`) — which the
//! from-bytes export path (CLI / MCP / SDK) never crosses. glTF 2.0 *mandates*
//! +Y up, and the viewer / legacy GLTFExporter output is Y-up, so the from-bytes
//! GLB/OBJ exporters must redo the identical conversion to match:
//!
//! - positions + normals: `(x, y, z) -> (x, z, -y)`
//! - triangle winding reversed (mirrors `MeshDataJs::new`, keeps front faces)
//! - per-element `origin` swapped the same way
//!
//! The from-meshes GLB path (the viewer's own `MeshData`) is already Y-up and
//! must NOT be re-swapped — only this from-bytes path applies it.

/// Convert a single IFC Z-up point/vector to WebGL Y-up: `(x, y, z) -> (x, z, -y)`.
