//! Shared fixture access for this crate's tests.
//!
//! Catalogued fixtures under `tests/models/` are not committed (see
//! `tests/models/manifest.json`), so a test that needs one must SKIP when it is
//! absent rather than throw or panic (AGENTS.md). Eleven modules here had each
//! grown their own `fixture()` helper that did the opposite -- `unwrap_or_else(|e|
//! panic!(...))` -- which turned a plain `cargo test --workspace` on a fresh
//! checkout into 38 failures that look like real defects. Three of the eleven had
//! separately grown a correct `fixture_opt` beside the panicking one, so both
//! behaviours shipped side by side in the same file.
//!
//! This is the one place that decides. Use [`fixture_or_skip!`] from a test.
//!
//! A skip here is a real `eprintln!`, but `cargo test` captures stdout/stderr
//! for a test that passes and only releases the buffer on failure -- so on a
//! plain `cargo test` (no `--nocapture`) the skip message is written and then
//! thrown away, and the only trace of it is the test showing `ok` like every
//! other one. That is issue #2802: a passing `fixture_or_skip!` test looks
//! identical, in the only output anyone reads, to one that actually asserted
//! something. `IFC_LITE_REQUIRE_FIXTURES=1` closes that for CI: with it set,
//! a missing fixture is a hard `panic!` (a real failure, never captured away)
//! instead of a skip. CI already runs `pnpm fixtures` before `cargo test`, so
//! setting this var there costs nothing on a correct run and turns fixture
//! drift into a loud failure instead of a quietly-smaller test suite. Unset
//! (the default), behavior is unchanged: a fixture-less local `cargo test` is
//! still a legitimate, silently-skipping workflow.
//!
//! The value is parsed strictly (see [`require_fixtures`]): only `"1"` turns
//! the gate on and only unset/empty/`"0"` leave it off. An unrecognised value
//! -- `true`, `yes`, `TRUE` -- panics instead of being treated as either,
//! because falling through to "off" for a typo would recreate exactly the
//! silent-pass problem this module exists to close.

/// Parse `IFC_LITE_REQUIRE_FIXTURES`, failing closed on the config itself.
///
/// Unset, empty, or `"0"` means "off" (the historical default: skip). `"1"`
/// means "on". Anything else -- `true`, `yes`, `TRUE`, a typo -- panics rather
/// than being treated as either value. A `== Ok("1")` check that let
/// unrecognised strings fall through to "off" would land the misconfiguration
/// on the permissive side: `IFC_LITE_REQUIRE_FIXTURES=true` in a workflow file
/// would read as "gate enabled" while actually leaving every fixture test free
/// to skip, silently and indistinguishably from the gate working -- exactly
/// the failure mode this module exists to remove. Guessing "off" for an
/// unrecognised value would reproduce that; refusing to guess does not.
