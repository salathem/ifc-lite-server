//! What the attribute export can be asked to resolve, and the placement it
//! resolves.
//!
//! Split from `model.rs` under the house rule (AGENTS.md). Keeping `Placement`
//! here also keeps its frame documentation — the part that is easy to get wrong
//! and expensive to get wrong — beside the type rather than buried in the
//! streaming pass.

/// A product's placement, composed from its `IfcLocalPlacement` chain.
///
/// **Which frame this is in**, because the crate contains three and a bare
/// `[f64; 16]` cannot tell them apart:
///
/// * **Column-major** 4×4 (nalgebra's `as_slice` order). Translation is at
///   indices 12, 13, 14 — not 3, 7, 11. The instancing path uses ROW-major
///   (`mat4_to_row_major`); this is not that.
/// * Translation is in **metres**: the file's length unit scale is applied. The
///   basis is unitless.
/// * **No RTC rebase.** Georeferenced models are shifted toward the origin for
///   f32 precision before meshing; this is not shifted.
/// * **No Z-up → Y-up conversion.** The glTF and OBJ exporters map
///   `(x, y, z) → (x, z, −y)`; this does not.
///
/// So: the IFC world frame, which is the frame the file itself is in and not the
/// frame any exporter emits. A consumer combining this with exported geometry
/// has to account for the last two itself.
