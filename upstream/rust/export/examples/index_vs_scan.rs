//! Split `relationships` and `extract_georeferencing` into the two costs they
//! actually pay, so a fix aims at the bigger one.
//!
//! Both walk every entity with an `EntityScanner`, and that scan is the larger
//! half. An entity index is the smaller one, which is why "share the index" is
//! worth doing and is not worth overselling.
//!
//! Read the two rows against `bare type-name scan`:
//!
//! * `relationships()` builds no index and should sit near the bare scan. If it
//!   drifts well above, someone has given it one again.
//! * `extract_georeferencing()` needs an index, because the extractor resolves
//!   its references by id. It builds one unless the caller passes it in through
//!   `extract_georeferencing_with_index`.
//!
//!     cargo run --release -p ifc-lite-export --example index_vs_scan -- <file.ifc>
