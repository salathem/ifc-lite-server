//! WASM API: splitMeshByZones - cut one element into one closed solid per
//! location zone (issue #2508 item 2).
//!
//! The kernel side is `ifc_lite_geometry::zone_split`; this is the boundary.
//! Two things about the contract matter more than the shape:
//!
//! - **Everything is in the CALLER's frame.** The viewer passes render-frame
//!   positions (Y-up, RTC-subtracted, metres) and zone boxes authored against
//!   that same frame, so no conversion happens here and none is implied. The
//!   only axis assumption is that zone rotation is about Y, which is the
//!   viewer's own zone model.
//! - **Positions cross as f64.** The split's whole value over an AABB estimate
//!   is exactness, and a per-piece f64 -> f32 -> f64 round trip at this
//!   boundary would put a crack back into every shared zone plane. The caller
//!   narrows to f32 when it uploads to the GPU, once, at the end.

/// (matching the viewer's `Zone.size`) and the rotation is radians about the
/// vertical axis. A trailing partial zone is ignored rather than guessed at.
///
/// A zone becomes a PRISM (#2508 item 4) when `footprint_counts[i]` is at
/// least 3: it then takes that many `[x, z]` pairs from `footprints`, in order,
/// and uses the 7-tuple only for its vertical extent (`cy +/- sy/2`). The
/// footprint must be CONVEX; the viewer gates that on import, because a concave
/// polygon fans into overlapping triangles and would cut wrong rather than
/// fail. A count of 1 or 2 is not a polygon: it still consumes its pairs, so
/// later zones stay aligned, and leaves that zone a box. Passing empty arrays
/// keeps every zone a box.
///
/// The caller must have established that the mesh is a closed orientable solid
/// first, exactly as it must before quoting a volume at all (#1891/#1993): a
/// clip of an open shell produces pieces whose volumes are arbitrary rather
/// than approximate.
///
/// A triangle with an out-of-range index or a non-finite coordinate is DROPPED
/// rather than reported, matching `kernel::mesh_bridge::mesh_to_tris`, which is
/// panic-free for the same reason: the alternative is a crash deep in the
/// predicates. It does mean a malformed caller can open the surface and get
/// meaningless volumes with a plausible `sumErrorRel`, so the closure proof
/// above is the caller's responsibility and not a formality.
