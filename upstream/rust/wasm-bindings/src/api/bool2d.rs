//! WASM API: general 2D boolean operations over contour sets (issue #1863).
//!
//! Until now the only `i_overlay` capability crossing the boundary was the
//! fixed-purpose [`meshOutline2d`](super::mesh_outline). Downstream analytic
//! hidden-surface removal needs the general form, or it has to bolt a second
//! 2D geometry engine (with different winding and precision semantics) onto
//! the same pipeline:
//!
//! ```javascript
//! let occluders = new Contours2D(new Float64Array(), new Uint32Array()); // empty
//! for (const el of frontToBack) {
//!   const outline = Contours2D.fromMeshOutline(meshOutline2d(...));
//!   const visible = difference2d(outline, occluders);   // may split into islands
//!   const grown = union2d(occluders, outline);
//!   occluders.free();
//!   occluders = grown;
//!   emitSvgPath(visible);                                // fill-rule="nonzero"
//!   visible.free();
//!   outline.free();
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Every handle returned here owns wasm memory: `free()` it, and note that the
//! operations return NEW handles rather than mutating their operands, so an
//! accumulating loop must free the handle it replaces (as above).
//!
//! Winding carries outer-vs-hole (CCW covers, CW subtracts) and the fill rule
//! is always NonZero, matching `meshOutline2d`'s output and SVG
//! `fill-rule="nonzero"`. See `ifc_lite_geometry::contour_bool2d` for the
//! full contract.
