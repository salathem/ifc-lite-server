//! The truncation surface of [`SymbolicRepresentationCollection`].
//!
//! Also home to the reasoning behind `is_empty`'s truncation guard: a per-item
//! bound can fire having emitted nothing, so a truncated collection can hold no
//! primitives at all. A consumer that skips an "empty" collection would then
//! discard the only signal the browser gets that its drawing is clipped, since
//! geometry is client-side only. `SymbolicData::is_empty` in
//! `ifc-lite-processing` already refuses to call a truncated result empty; the
//! test below pins the two together rather than trusting two definitions to
//! stay in step.
//!
//! Split out of `symbolic.rs` rather than raising that file's ratchet budget:
//! the budget exists so a god-file cannot grow one accessor at a time, and
//! "the new field needed a getter" is exactly the increment it is meant to
//! refuse. These read one field and belong together (#2938).
