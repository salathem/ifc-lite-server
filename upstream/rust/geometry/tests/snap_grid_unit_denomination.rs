//! #2684 — `SNAP_GRID` is denominated in the CALLER's unit, not in metres.
//!
//! These tests do not fix the divergence; they make it VISIBLE and pin the
//! argument for which way it should eventually be fixed. Today the divergence
//! is invisible: nothing fails, nothing warns, and the constant's own doc
//! comment used to claim "metres" — so the only way to discover it was to
//! measure the operands, which is how #2681's watertightness census split went
//! unexplained for a while.
//!
//! WHAT IS ESTABLISHED HERE, by measurement rather than by argument:
//!
//! 1. f32 import noise is physically invariant TO WITHIN A FACTOR OF 2. The same
//!    physical point carries near-enough the same physical ULP whether the file
//!    says metres or millimetres, because f32 is a RELATIVE precision and the
//!    physical coordinate is identical. The residue is binade alignment: 1000 is
//!    not a power of two, so the two coordinates land 2^9 or 2^10 apart in
//!    exponent and the ratio is exactly 2^Δ/1000 ∈ {1.024, 1.953}. Swept over
//!    200k log-uniform magnitudes from 1 cm to 10 km: **1.024x for ~96.5% of
//!    magnitudes, 1.953x for the other ~3.5%** — the worst case landing at
//!    64.77 m, one binade below this file's 66.8 m probe. So "invariant" is the
//!    honest word only with that bound attached, which is why the assertion
//!    below is `< 2.0` and not `≈ 1`.
//!
//! 2. `SNAP_GRID` is NOT physically invariant. It is 15.26 µm in a metre file
//!    and 15.26 nm in a millimetre one — 1000x, decided by authoring convention.
//!
//! 3. Therefore the ratio that actually matters — grid ÷ noise, i.e. "is the
//!    snap coarse enough to absorb the f32 jitter it exists to absorb?" — is
//!    2.0 in a metre file (works as designed) and 0.002 in a millimetre file,
//!    where the grid is ~500x finer than the noise.
//!
//! 4. The snap therefore goes INERT past |c| = 128 CALLER UNITS, where the f32
//!    spacing becomes a multiple of the grid so every f32 is already on it.
//!    Verified by exhaustive f32 sweep, not inferred. That is 12.8 cm in a
//!    millimetre file — i.e. EVERY building coordinate — and 128 m in a metre
//!    one, so even metre files lose the snap far from the origin.
//!
//! THE CONCLUSION THAT FOLLOWS: since the noise being absorbed is physically
//! invariant, the grid absorbing it must be physically invariant too. That
//! argues for a `unit_scale`-relative grid (fixed PHYSICAL size), not the
//! current file-unit-relative one (fixed RELATIVE precision). The ≤2x binade
//! wobble in point 1 does not weaken this: it is a factor of two against a
//! factor of a thousand, and a millimetre file's grid/noise stays below 0.004
//! at every building-scale magnitude either way.
//!
//! HOW THIS FILE GOES STALE, since the tripwires below cannot see every fix.
//! Both of them probe the KERNEL-visible grid, via `subtract` and via the
//! mirrored constant. A fix at the SEAM instead — scaling operands to metres
//! inside `BooleanProcessor` before the kernel, leaving `mesh_to_tris` and
//! `SNAP_GRID` untouched — would fix production while leaving all three tests
//! green and this header quietly wrong. If you fix #2684 that way, update this
//! file by hand; nothing here will tell you to.
//!
//! WHY THAT FIX IS NOT IN THIS FILE: `SNAP_GRID` must stay a POWER OF TWO or the
//! snap `(c/G).round()*G` stops being an exact f64 op and the kernel loses
//! bit-determinism across x86_64/aarch64/wasm. A physically-fixed grid would
//! therefore have to be the power of two NEAREST the target physical size
//! (2^-16 in a metre file, 2^-6 in a millimetre one), and it must be threaded
//! through `ClippingProcessor` (which carries no `unit_scale` today) and the
//! public `subtract`/`union`/`intersection` signatures. It also moves
//! coordinates, so it perturbs both pinned determinism manifests and the
//! watertightness census by construction. That is its own PR with its own
//! corpus evidence — the same reasoning `csg/plane_eps.rs` records for the
//! clipper's epsilon floor, which carries the identical unit question.
//!
//! WHY THIS IS A CONTROLLED SYNTHETIC COMPARISON AND NOT A CORPUS SPLIT.
//!
//! The obvious way to evidence #2684 is to split the watertightness census by
//! authoring unit and compare. That instrument is INVALID here, and measuring
//! it says so loudly. Over the 33 censused models:
//!
//!     unit         hosts with open edges     open edges/host (worst model dropped)
//!     millimetre   4.8%  (18/375)            1.22
//!     metre        36.5% (178/488)           12.20
//!
//! Read naively that says the INERT-snap millimetre files are 7.6x healthier,
//! i.e. the opposite of this file's thesis. It says no such thing: the metre
//! offenders are all Revit exports (ISSUE_129, rvt01, duplex, Snowdon,
//! ISSUE_159 - versions 2011 through 2024), while the millimetre models come
//! from ArchiCAD, Allplan and others. **Authoring unit is collinear with
//! exporter in this corpus**, and exporter dominates geometry difficulty, so a
//! unit-split census measures the exporter and reports it as a unit effect.
//!
//! Hence the synthetic fixtures below: identical physical geometry, two
//! authoring units, everything else held constant. That is the only comparison
//! in which the unit is the sole varying term. A corpus number would look more
//! authoritative and mean less.
//!
//! Run with:
//!   cargo test -p ifc-lite-geometry --test snap_grid_unit_denomination -- --nocapture
