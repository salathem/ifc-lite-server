//! Regression for #1909: content-dedup's structural signature walk
//! (`item_dedup_key` -> `content_hash::item_signature` ->
//! `try_faceted_brep_signature`) mirrors the mesher's own face/bound/loop/point
//! traversal of an `IfcFacetedBrep`. On a model consisting of ONE large faceted
//! BREP (reported: ~2.5M triangles, no curved surfaces, no booleans) that hash
//! has no possible payback -- there is no sibling item to match -- so computing
//! it doubles the traversal cost of an already-expensive mesh. The reporter
//! measured `GeometryProcessor.processStreaming` at ~30s where web-ifc's
//! `StreamAllMeshes` (open + geometry) took ~2.85s on the same file.
//!
//! `EntityDecoder::point_cache_stats()` (hits, misses) is a pre-existing,
//! always-on counter fed by `get_polyloop_coords_cached` -- the SAME cache both
//! the signature walk and the faceted mesher read through. It gives a
//! deterministic, non-timing proxy for "how many times was every point of this
//! BREP visited": one full traversal (dedup off, or dedup on but skipped for
//! size) touches every point once (all misses); two traversals (the pre-fix
//! bug) touch every point twice -- once to build the signature (misses, since
//! nothing is cached yet) and once to mesh (hits, since the signature walk
//! already warmed the cache).
//!
//! Synthesizes a large single-instance faceted BREP procedurally (no fixture
//! file: a `nx` x `ny` grid of shared `IfcCartesianPoint`s triangulated into
//! `2*nx*ny` `IfcFace`s in one `IfcClosedShell`/`IfcFacetedBrep`, mirroring the
//! shared-point structure of `tests/fixtures/shared_point_faceted_brep.ifc`)
//! rather than requiring the reporter's un-shippable `BigModel.ifc`.
