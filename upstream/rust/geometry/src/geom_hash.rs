//! Per-entity geometry fingerprinting for model diffing.
//!
//! The viewer's "compare two revisions" feature needs a stable per-entity
//! signature so an unchanged element hashes identically across two files,
//! while a genuine edit (moved, or reshaped so the surface itself changes)
//! hashes differently. Re-cutting an unchanged surface over the SAME corners is
//! *not* an edit and deliberately does not move the hash — see
//! **Retriangulation-invariant** below for the exact scope of that guarantee,
//! and [`GeometryHasher::finish`] for what the fingerprint can and cannot
//! distinguish.
//!
//! ## Design invariants
//!
//! * **RTC-invariant.** Each file independently shifts world coordinates toward
//!   the origin (Relative-To-Center) to preserve `f32` precision. That shift is
//!   a property of the *file*, not the element, and the base and head files may
//!   pick different offsets. We therefore hash in reconstructed **world**
//!   coordinates (`local + rtc_offset`), so the same wall in the same world
//!   spot hashes the same regardless of each file's RTC choice.
//! * **Translation-sensitive.** Because we hash absolute world position, an
//!   element that genuinely *moved* hashes differently — a moved element is an
//!   edit ("orange"), not "unchanged".
//! * **Order/winding-invariant.** Triangle order, vertex-buffer order, and
//!   winding are implementation details of the geometry kernel, not the shape.
//!   Each triangle's three quantized vertices are sorted before hashing, and
//!   triangles are combined commutatively, so reordering/rewinding does not move
//!   the hash.
//! * **Retriangulation-invariant, over a fixed vertex set.** So is the
//!   triangulator's DIAGONAL CHOICE. The hash is therefore taken over the
//!   SURFACE, in two channels re-cutting cannot move — the SET of distinct
//!   quantized vertices, and the total area within each supporting PLANE (see
//!   [`surface`]).
//!
//!   The guarantee is exactly this: re-cutting a region over the corners it
//!   already has (a re-split diagonal, a re-rooted fan) does not move the hash.
//!   It does **not** extend to a tessellation that INTRODUCES vertices — a quad
//!   refanned through a new centre point, or an edge split at a new midpoint,
//!   adds a member to the vertex-set channel and so does hash differently, even
//!   though the surface and its per-plane area are unchanged. Distinguishing
//!   that from a genuine edit needs a channel this fingerprint does not have.
//!   See [`GeometryHasher::finish`] for the rest of the limits.
//! * **Tolerance-quantized.** Positions are snapped to a grid of `tolerance`
//!   metres before hashing. Larger tolerance absorbs float noise (fewer false
//!   "changed") at the cost of missing sub-tolerance edits. See
//!   [`DEFAULT_GEOM_HASH_TOLERANCE`] and the `tolerance_sweep` test for the
//!   trade-off — the effective floor is the `f32` precision of the local
//!   positions (~1e-4 m near origin), so tolerances below ~1 mm mostly hash
//!   float noise. A request finer than [`MIN_GEOM_HASH_TOLERANCE`] is clamped
//!   up to it: below that grid, [`surface::plane_of`]'s `i128` plane-offset
//!   arithmetic is an overflow surface on a georeferenced model, not a
//!   precision win — see that constant for the measured bound.
//!
//! All inputs must be in a single consistent frame for both files (i.e. unit
//! scaled to metres, and either both pre- or both post- any axis convention
//! swap). The caller is responsible for feeding `positions` and `rtc_offset`
//! in the same frame.
//!
//! ## World AABB (#1891 follow-on)
//!
//! The same pass also accumulates an UNQUANTIZED `f64` world axis-aligned
//! bounding box ([`GeometryHasher::world_aabb`]). The hash alone cannot say
//! WHY two revisions differ — "hash changed" conflates moved, reshaped and
//! re-tessellated — so the diff engine needs a second, interpretable signal.
//! The box is free here: `add_mesh_with_origin` already reconstructs the exact
//! `f64` world coordinate of every triangle corner in order to quantize it.
//!
//! ## Volume, and its gate (#1891)
//!
//! [`GeometryHasher::volume`] is the divergence-theorem volume of the same
//! geometry — but only for entities whose produced mesh is PROVABLY a single
//! closed orientable solid. That proof comes from
//! [`crate::orient_mesh_outward_verdict`], which the producer runs on each
//! segment immediately before feeding it here; the hasher cannot derive it
//! itself, because the adjacency needed to decide closedness is exactly what
//! that pass builds.
//!
//! Everything else gets `None`. Read [`GeometryHasher::volume`] before
//! loosening any clause of that gate — each one is there because a specific,
//! measured class of element reports a confidently wrong number without it,
//! and none of the wrong numbers look wrong. [`GeometryClosure`] rides along so
//! a consumer can say WHICH clause refused.

/// The volume gate (`GeometryClosure` + `GeometryHasher::volume`). A CHILD
/// module, not a sibling, so it can read this module's private accumulators
/// without widening their visibility.

///
/// What it actually depends on is the **largest absolute post-rebase
/// coordinate** staying under ~16384 m (where the `f32` ULP crosses 1 mm) — an
/// incidental dependency, not a designed one. Note that is a magnitude, not a
/// span: a model centred on the origin can span ~32 km and still satisfy it,
/// while one sitting 20 km out fails it however small it is. RTC re-centring
/// makes the condition typical but does not guarantee it, in two ways worth
/// stating rather than implying:
///
///  - `rtc_offset_from_translations` takes the **median** element translation
///    and returns `(0,0,0)` unless it exceeds
///    [`LARGE_COORD_THRESHOLD_METERS`](crate::LARGE_COORD_THRESHOLD_METERS).
///    A model whose bulk sits near the origin but whose outlying elements sit
///    on a national grid is therefore not re-centred at all, and those vertices
///    are hashed from `f32` world coordinates already past this bucket.
///  - Even when the rebase does fire, the offset it subtracts is the median
///    element translation, not the model's centre. A model is therefore not
///    centred on it, so an outlier can still land past 16384 m even when the
///    overall span would have fitted had the rebase been centred.
///
/// So raising that threshold is not the only thing that would need this
/// tolerance revisited; a far-flung or widely spread model reaches the same
/// place without any constant changing.
