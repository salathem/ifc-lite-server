/// Signed volume of a `Mesh`, via the divergence theorem.
///
/// Positive for a closed, outward-wound mesh; negative if inward-wound;
/// meaningless if the mesh is not closed — the divergence theorem this sum
/// implements requires a closed surface, and an open one has no true volume
/// to read regardless of where it sits. That reading is translation-stable
/// only up to a bounded QUANTIZATION noise floor, not exactly
/// translation-invariant: [`mesh_to_tris`] rounds every coordinate to
/// `kernel::mesh_bridge::SNAP_GRID` (1/65536 m, ~15.26 µm) before this
/// function ever sees it, and a non-grid-aligned translation moves each
/// vertex's rounding independently, so the sum drifts by roughly
/// `surface_area * SNAP_GRID` (plus, at far-from-origin offsets, the
/// coarser f32-ulp term the `Mesh` positions already carried on the way in).
/// Because it delegates to `signed_volume6`, which sums about the
/// operand's own AABB centre rather than a fixed point, that drift is the
/// ONLY thing that moves the reading — a world-origin implementation would
/// additionally vary with the reference point itself, wrong by orders of
/// magnitude more (see the
/// `mesh_volume_is_stable_far_from_the_world_origin_for_an_open_mesh` test
/// below, which pins the AABB-centred reading's noise floor and would fail
/// hard against that class of regression). It is still not the mesh's actual
/// volume. Callers that need a trustworthy reading (e.g. reporting a split
/// zone piece's volume) must establish closedness first, same requirement
/// `signed_volume6` itself carries.
///
/// Delegates to `signed_volume_of` - itself one line over `signed_volume6`,
/// which returns SIX times the volume - rather than dividing here as well.
/// #2579 landed that helper an hour before this file did, with a doc that says
/// exactly why the divide belongs in one place: "a caller that wants the VOLUME
/// divides once, here, rather than growing a second hand-rolled sum in another
/// module, which is how two producers of the same number start to disagree."
///
/// The reference point is what makes the shared implementation matter:
/// `signed_volume6` deliberately sums about the OPERAND'S OWN AABB CENTRE
/// rather than the world origin. That
/// choice is not cosmetic — see `signed_volume::signed_volume6`'s doc for the
/// #198779 incident where a world-origin reference turned a crack sliver on a
/// far-from-origin operand into a wildly wrong, sign-flipping volume. A split
/// zone piece is exactly the shape of operand that provokes this: it can sit
/// anywhere in a building/national-grid-scale model and can carry the same
/// kind of boundary sliver from the cut that produced it, so this function
/// inherits the AABB-centred reference rather than exposing a second,
/// world-origin-referenced volume primitive alongside it.
///
/// This is a raw, UNGATED kernel primitive — it reads whatever `Mesh` it is
/// handed, closed or not, and (via [`mesh_to_tris`]) silently drops any
/// out-of-range-index or non-finite triangle. It is the low-level counterpart
/// to `geom_closure::GeometryHasher::volume`, which is the crate's
/// closedness-GATED, per-entity volume: that one returns `None` unless the
/// hasher's accumulated `GeometryClosure` proves the entity is a single
/// closed orientable solid, but it requires that accumulated per-entity
/// state — it has nothing to gate a bare, freshly-produced `Mesh` (e.g. a
/// zone-split piece) that never went through the hasher. A caller of THIS
/// function that needs the same trustworthiness guarantee must establish
/// closedness itself first — `router::voids::geom::mesh_is_closed_exact` is
/// the crate's existing closed-surface check but is `pub(super)`-scoped to
/// that module today, so a caller outside it needs either that visibility
/// widened or an equivalent check of its own — same requirement
/// `GeometryHasher::volume`'s own gate establishes upstream.
///
/// The other volume readings already in the crate were each wrong for this
/// job for a different reason: `router::voids::geom::mesh_signed_volume`
/// sums about the world origin (fine for its own callers, which only ever see
/// frame-local meshes near the origin — not true of an arbitrary zone piece),
/// and `kernel::mesh_bridge`'s `#[cfg(test)]`-only helper duplicates that same
/// world-origin arithmetic for test-only use. Reusing `signed_volume6`
/// avoids adding another divergence-theorem implementation to reconcile.
