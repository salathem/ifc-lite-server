//! Normal-projected near-coplanar band for the exact kernel.
//!
//! Extracted from `kernel/mesh_bridge.rs` so the band-sizing concern lives in
//! one place, exactly as `csg/plane_eps.rs` (#2598) extracted the clipper's
//! plane epsilon. Deliberately the SAME formulation as that module and as its
//! TypeScript siblings — `epsForPlane` in
//! `packages/clash/src/contact/tri-tri.ts` (#2661) and the LOCAL-coordinate
//! tolerance sizing in `packages/drawing-2d/src/section-cutter.ts` (#2622) —
//! not a fourth one.
//!
//! # What was wrong with the scalar band
//!
//! [`near_band_from_extent`] takes ONE scalar `extent`, the max |coordinate|
//! over ALL THREE axes of both operands, and returns
//! `max(8*SNAP_GRID, extent * 2^-22)`. Its consumers then compare that band
//! against a PERPENDICULAR distance to a specific plane. A signed plane
//! distance is `dot(v - p, n)`, so each coordinate's f32 rounding noise enters
//! it weighted by that axis's normal component: an axis orthogonal to `n`
//! contributes nothing however far it puts the model from the origin.
//!
//! Collapsing the three axes to their max therefore sizes the band from an
//! axis the plane never sees. A model 10 km out in X, cut by a Z-normal
//! plane, got `band = 1e4 * 2^-22 ~= 2.4 mm` from the irrelevant X magnitude
//! where the real f32 rounding step in Z is ~1.2e-4 (the `8*SNAP_GRID`
//! floor). Two surfaces a genuine 2 mm apart then fell inside the band, were
//! reconciled as flush, and a 2 mm recess VANISHED — the same thin-flush-cut
//! collapse #2598 described for the clipper, live in the kernel's shared band
//! (`csg/world_frame_tests.rs::a_2mm_recess_cuts_identically_10km_out_in_x`,
//! far volume 0.3000030517580399 vs expected 0.29968).
//!
//! [`NearBand`] keeps the extent PER AXIS and projects it onto the plane's own
//! normal instead.
//!
//! # Determinism
//!
//! Plain FMA-free f64 (abs/mul/add/max) over already-snapped input
//! coordinates, fixed iteration order, no square root anywhere — the
//! comparison is made in the scaled `|n|`-weighted space precisely so no
//! normalisation is needed. Byte-identical native == wasm, like every other
//! predicate in this kernel.
