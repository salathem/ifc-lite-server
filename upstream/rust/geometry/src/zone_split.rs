//! Cut one element into one solid per location zone (issue #2508 item 2).
//!
//! #2515 answers "how much of this wall is in Takt A" with a number, by
//! integrating the zone's indicator function over the element's own boundary.
//! That is the right tool for a quantity and it produces no geometry at all:
//! there is nothing to look at, select, or export as a per-section model. This
//! module produces the geometry, on the explicit request of a user who asked
//! for it.
//!
//! ## Why this is a kernel call and not new geometry code
//!
//! Clipping a solid to a convex box is an INTERSECTION against a convex
//! operand, which is strictly easier than the general difference the exact
//! kernel already runs on every opening void of every model. So each piece is
//! one `boolean(host, box, Intersection)`, and the remainder is one
//! `difference_all` against every box at once. Nothing here re-derives cutting,
//! capping or classification.
//!
//! ## Two decisions worth stating
//!
//! - **One arrangement per piece, N+1 in total, not N composed operations.**
//!   Composing (cut by A, then cut the rest by B, ...) feeds each step the
//!   PREVIOUS step's output, so every cut re-snaps and re-jitters seams the
//!   last one made. Each piece instead arranges the ORIGINAL host against one
//!   box, and the remainder arranges the original host against all the boxes
//!   together.
//! - **f64 from end to end.** Operands stay `Tri` (f64) for the whole split and
//!   only reach `Mesh` (f32) at the caller's boundary. A per-piece f64 -> f32 ->
//!   f64 round trip is what turns a shared zone boundary into a crack.
