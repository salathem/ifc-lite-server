//! Direction-aware plane-distance tolerance for the CSG clipper.
//!
//! Extracted from `csg/mod.rs` so the tolerance-sizing concern — and the two
//! doc comments carrying its reasoning and its known limitation — lives in one
//! place. Ported from the TypeScript `ProjectedPlaneEps` / `epsForPlane` pair
//! in `packages/clash/src/contact/{narrow-phase,tri-tri}.ts` (#2661), itself
//! following the LOCAL-vs-world tolerance sizing in `section-cutter.ts`
//! (#2622). Deliberately the same formulation as the clash narrow phase, not
//! a new one.
//!
//! This does NOT mean the crate now has a single plane-epsilon formulation.
//! Two neighbours keep their own, both pre-existing and untouched here;
//! converging either needs its own change with its own evidence:
//!
//! - `router/voids/aabb_clip.rs` — max over axes, scaled by `1e-6` rather than
//!   `2^-22`, against a hand-rolled copy of `clip_triangle`'s body that does
//!   not route through [`clip_triangle_with_epsilon`].
//! - `processors/boolean/halfspace_cap.rs:87` — `on_plane_eps =
//!   (diag * 1e-5).max(1e-6)`, evaluated immediately after this clip on the
//!   half-space path. It is sized by a different quantity (the mesh's bounding
//!   box DIAGONAL, i.e. its size) than the one here (the mesh's coordinate
//!   MAGNITUDE, i.e. its offset), so no fixed ratio holds between them: for a
//!   mesh near its local origin `diag * 1e-5` is ~42x looser
//!   (`1e-5 / 2^-22 ~= 41.9`), while for a far-offset mesh this module's
//!   epsilon overtakes it. Either way there is no interaction to reason about
//!   — it runs on the clip's OUTPUT and only decides cap-ring membership; it
//!   never revisits a front/back verdict.
//!
//! # The floor, and its known unit-divergence limitation
//!
//! [`super::ClippingProcessor::epsilon`] supplies [`PlaneEps`]'s floor. It is
//! a raw `f64` constant that is never rescaled by `unit_scale`, so WHICH unit
//! it is denominated in is decided entirely by the caller — and the two
//! production `clip_mesh` callers differ:
//!
//! - FILE UNITS (pre-scale): `processors/boolean/mod.rs`
//!   (`IfcHalfSpaceSolid` / `IfcPolygonalBoundedHalfSpace`) clips inside
//!   `BooleanProcessor::process`, which the router dispatches at
//!   `router/processing.rs:818` and only unit-scales afterwards at `:846`.
//!   Both mesh and plane are in the file's native unit there — millimetres for
//!   most IFC files, not metres.
//! - METRES (post-scale): `router/layers.rs:569-570` (layered-material band
//!   splitting) clips a `base_mesh` returned by `process_element_with_voids`,
//!   which routes through `process_element` and has therefore already run
//!   `scale_mesh` and `apply_placement`. Its interface planes are built from
//!   `thickness_m`, `offset * scale` and the metre-valued `rtc_offset`
//!   (`layers.rs:246-273`). Both operands are in metres.
//!
//! KNOWN LIMITATION (pre-existing, not introduced by the magnitude-scaling
//! fix; applies to the FILE-UNIT boolean path — the layers path is always
//! metres, so it has no unit variance of its own, only the fixed `1e-6 m` =
//! 1 micrometre floor): because the floor is a fixed constant with no unit
//! attached, identical physical geometry can classify differently depending on
//! whether the file is authored in metres or millimetres. The projected term
//! overtakes the floor at a projected noise amplitude of about 4.19 file units
//! (`1e-6 / 2^-22 ~= 4.194304`) — above that both unit choices converge on the
//! same scaled epsilon. Below it a metre-authored file stays floored at a
//! constant `1e-6 m` regardless of how small the operand gets, while a
//! millimetre-authored file's scaled term keeps shrinking with the operand
//! (its floor, `1e-6 mm`, is a nanometre and is essentially never reached).
//! For a real-world projected noise amplitude of `E` metres below the
//! crossover the two therefore differ by a factor of `1e-6 / (E * 2^-22) =
//! 4.194 / E` — about 4x at `E = 1 m`, about 42x at `E = 0.1 m`, and unbounded
//! as `E` shrinks. (Earlier prose here quoted a flat "~40x"; that is the
//! `E ~= 0.1 m` case only, not a bound.) Both sides remain sub-micrometre, and
//! no building-scale corpus fixture has exercised it. Left undone
//! deliberately: rescaling this floor by `unit_scale` is exactly the kind of
//! tolerance change that needs its own PR with its own corpus evidence, not a
//! fold-in-on-review-comment fix (see the 122x-looser-floor mistake avoided by
//! not reusing `near_band_from_extent`).
//!
//! # Why not `near_band_from_extent`
//!
//! Despite sharing the `2^-22` term, `near_band_from_extent`
//! (`kernel/near_band.rs`) is not reused here: its floor (`8*SNAP_GRID`
//! ~= 1.22e-4) is sized for the exact kernel's snap grid and is only overtaken
//! past ~512 m, so at building extents it would flatten the epsilon 122x
//! looser.
