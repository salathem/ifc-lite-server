/// The flag matters only for the conformed pass. A region whose CDT fails is
/// skipped, and on the conformed candidate that is not survivable: the accept bar
/// tests watertightness, and a dropped region that happened to be its own closed
/// component leaves the remainder edge-balanced, so a candidate missing a whole
/// surface component would be accepted. The caller rejects the candidate outright
