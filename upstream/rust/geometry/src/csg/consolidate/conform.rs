//! Cross-bucket seam conforming for `consolidate_coplanar`.
//!
//! `consolidate_coplanar` re-triangulates each coplanar plane bucket independently.
//! Where a bucket's boundary runs along a facet shared with an abutting bucket, its
//! collinear simplify can drop a vertex the neighbour keeps — the shared edge is then
//! spanned by one long edge on one side and two short ones on the other. That is a
//! T-junction, and it renders as a hairline crack.
//!
//! The discrimination this module rests on: a GENUINE seam vertex is a hard corner in
//! the abutting bucket, so it survives that bucket's own simplify and gets recorded
//! here. An i_overlay PHANTOM (a fragment-boundary artefact the simplify exists to
//! remove) is near-collinear in every bucket that touches it, is dropped everywhere,
//! and therefore never becomes an insertion source. The simplify's own judgment,
//! read across buckets, is the discriminator — no geometric proxy for "is this a real
//! corner" is needed.
//!
//! Split out of `consolidate.rs` to keep both files under the module-size ratchet.
