//! The ONE definition of the server wire's axis convention (issue #1841).
//!
//! IFC is Z-up; WebGL/glTF (and every ifc-lite client) is Y-up. Every server
//! transport therefore emits **Y-up metres**, and this module is the single
//! place that conversion is defined.
//!
//! It used to be open-coded inline in each parquet serializer and simply
//! MISSING from the JSON route, so `POST /api/v1/parse` shipped raw IFC Z-up
//! while the parquet endpoints shipped Y-up — the same class of silent
//! per-transport drift as the dropped `origin`. Keep every transport routed
//! through these helpers so the frame can never diverge again.
